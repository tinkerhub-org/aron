TinkerHub Portal (Frontend)

This repo contains code that is not working or broken as this repo is being updated after every minor/major change to the code. You might see errors or the app might not work as expected, so please bear in mind that this is a work in progress.

All the above Vue projects are generated from the started vue-router app using the Vue CLI, so many default values and assets such as the Vue logo is still remaining, which is yet to be changed.

This is a Vue 3 revamp of an earlier unfinished version.
