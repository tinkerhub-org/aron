# TinkerHub Portal - Frontend

**This repo contains code that is not working or broken as this repo is being updated after every minor/major change to the code. You might see errors or the app might not work as expected, so please bear in mind that this is a work in progress.**

This repo will contain code and docs regarding the front-end designs and UI for the upcoming TinkerHub Portal.

- UI designs: `Figma URL here`
- UI preview (without Vue.js): https://tinkerhub-portal.glitch.me
- UI Preview Code: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/tinkerhub-portal
- Vue development server (lots of errors and very slow): https://tinkerhub-portal-vue.glitch.me

- **Style guide with instructions on UI styling at `docs/StylingGuide.md`**

The front-end UI will depend on the data provided from the back-end API. Backend repository can be found [here](https://github.com/tinkerhub-org/swartz).
